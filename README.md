# Faculty-Feedback-System
Faculty-Feedback-System is made using PHP HTML5 CSS and JAVASCRIPT . This is a very responsive website where Student Feedback System for college students have been developed which aims to rate and  analyse the college facultyâ€™s performance.  This type of Student Feedback system reduces, the strenuous work of physically examining  the feedback pages of each and every student.  The system also reduces the burden of efforts and burden of keeping and maintaining the  records on a manual base, it requires a lot of space and safety to keep up such records.

*Also further enhancement is done and more features can be added for better analysis of the feedback details like I have used **goolge charts API** to make the pi chart of the feedback.*
